===========
Quick start
===========

This tutorial shows how to create basic Hello World application where
one person starts "Hello, world" request, another one approves it, and
when approved the request sent out.

To follow the tutorial, you need to use Python>=3.4, but since 1.0
django-viewflow works also with Python 2.7


Initial steps
=============


Let's create a fresh virtual environment for the demo project. In an empty
directory run the following commands.

.. code-block:: shell

    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate


At first install viewflow package and django-material to enable pre-build frontend interface.

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install django django-material django-viewflow


In the current directory, scaffold a new django project:

.. code-block:: shell

   django-admin startproject demo .

Create an app:

.. code-block:: shell

   mkdir demo/helloworld
    ./manage.py startapp helloworld demo/helloworld


Now you should have following file structure:

.. code-block:: shell

    demo/
    ├── admin.py
    ├── apps.py
    ├── helloworld
    │   ├── admin.py
    │   ├── apps.py
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── migrations
    │   │   └── __init__.py
    │   ├── models.py
    │   ├── tests.py
    │   └── views.py
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── settings.py
    ├── urls.py
    ├── views.py
    └── wsgi.py


Configuration
=============

Open the `demo/settings.py` and add `viewflow` and `demo.helloworld`
into `INSTALLED_APPS` setting

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'viewflow',
        'demo.helloworld',
    ]


Define models
=============

Open `demo/helloworld/models.py` file and define a process model with `text` and `approved` fields,
to capture the process state during execution.

.. code-block:: python

    from django.db import models
    from viewflow.models import Process


    class HelloWorldProcess(Process):
        text = models.CharField(max_length=150)
        approved = models.BooleanField(default=False)


Define flow
===========

Let's take a look at the flow BPMN diagram. We are going to map each shape
to the corresponding flow node definition.

.. image:: _static/HelloWorld.png

Open the `demo/helloworld/flows.py` file and define:

.. code-block:: python
           
    from viewflow import flow
    from viewflow.base import this, Flow
    from viewflow.flow.views import CreateProcessView, UpdateProcessView

    from .models import HelloWorldProcess


    class HelloWorldFlow(Flow):
        process_class = HelloWorldProcess

        start = (
            flow.Start(
                CreateProcessView,
                fields=["text"]
            ).Permission(
                auto_create=True
            ).Next(this.approve)
        )

        approve = (
            flow.View(
                UpdateProcessView,
                fields=["approved"]
            ).Permission(
                auto_create=True
            ).Next(this.check_approve)
        )

        check_approve = (
            flow.If(lambda activation: activation.process.approved)
            .Then(this.send)
            .Else(this.end)
        )

        send = (
            flow.Handler(
                this.send_hello_world_request
            ).Next(this.end)
        )

        end = flow.End()

        def send_hello_world_request(self, activation):
            print(activation.process.text)

Viewflow proceeds all application flows from the `flows.py` file.

- Each flow is a Python class that subclasses `viewflow.base.Flow`
- Each attribute represents a flow task
- To connect flow tasks altogether, the special `this` object can be
  used to make forward references

`flow.Start` represents a task that is performed by a person in a Django
view. For the tutorial purpose, we use built-in
`CreateProcessView`. But any class or functional based view annotated
with `@flow.flow_start_view` decorator can be used here.

`flow.Task` is a user task for an existing process.

Tasks execution rights could be restricted by the Django permission
system. You can specify a permission name here or set
`auto_create=True` that leads to creating special permission for the
task. In our case, we will have
`helloworld.can_start_helloworldprocess` and
`helloworld.can_approve_helloworldprocess` permissions created. In
addition, two standard permissions would be created
`helloworld.view_helloworldprocess` and
`helloworld.manage_helloworldprocess` for flow list and
administrative actions views.

`flow.If` is the simple exclusive gateway. It selects an outcome
depending on a callable result. For the input, callable gets a task
`activation` - an object that handles current task processing logic,
and that has an `activation.process` and `activation.task` fields
initialized with the corresponding model instances.

If the request is approved, the `flow.Handler` will be
executed. `flow.Handler` is the task performed by synchronous Python
code call. Here a `this` reference could be used to point to a flow
instance method, or any Python callable.

`flow.End` finalizes the process and marks it as completed.


Enable frontend
===============

Here we could start to write a lot of templates for flow list, actions,
task details and task execution views. Viewflow comes with pre-build
frontend module, which provides ready to use UI, let's just enable it.

First, adds the required apps to the `INSTALLED_APPS`

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'material',
        'material.frontend',
        'viewflow',
        'viewflow.frontend',
        'demo.helloworld',
    ]

Add frontend URLs into global URL conf module at `demo/urls.py`

.. code-block:: python

    from django.conf.urls import include, url
    from django.views import generic
    from material.frontend import urls as frontend_urls

    urlpatterns = [
        url(r'^$', generic.RedirectView.as_view(url='/workflow/', permanent=False)),
        url(r'', include(frontend_urls)),
    ]

At the last step, open demo/helloworld/flows.py and register our flow in the `viewflow.frontend`.

.. code-block:: python

    from viewflow import frontend

    @frontend.register
    class HelloWorldFlow(Flow):
        ...

Run and explore
===============

Create migrations for the helloworld app.

.. code-block:: shell

    ./manage.py makemigrations helloworld

Apply it

.. code-block:: shell

    ./manage.py migrate

Create an admin user to initial login

.. code-block:: shell

    ./manage.py createsuperuser

Run the server

.. code-block:: shell

    ./manage.py runserver

Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 and see the viewflow in action!
