Introduction
============

Viewflow is the workflow library based on BPMN concepts. BPMN -
Business process modeling and notations - is the widely adopted industry
standard for business process modeling. BPMN provides a standard
notation readily understandable by all business stakeholders. Viewflow
bridges the gap between picture and executable, ready to use web
application.

After more than ten years history of the BPMN standard, it contains
the whole set of battle-proven primitives for all occasions and helps
you to describe all real life business process scenarios. Viewflow
assists you in building a BPMN diagram in code and keep business logic
separate from django forms and views code.

Viewflow suite has a modular design, and you can use viewflow core
library itself, or accompanied with pre-built UI frontend.
