Viewflow Frontend
=================

Introduction
============

Reference UI implementation for the Viewflow Workflow library.


Installation
============

Add `material.frontend` and `viewflow.frontend` into INSTALLED_APPS settings

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        # viewflow
        'viewflow.frontend',
        'viewflow',

        # material
        'material',
        'material.frontend',
        'material.admin',
             ...
    )

*NOTE:* to redefine standard viewflow templates, 'viewflow.frontend' should be added before 'django.contrib.admin'

Add frontend urls into global url config module at urls.py

.. code-block:: python

    from material.frontend import urls as frontend_urls

    urlpatterns = [
        ...
        path('', include(frontend_urls)),
    ]


Quick start
===========

In the flows.py file, register a flow in the frontend

.. code-block:: python

    from viewflow import frontend

    @frontend.register
    class MyFlow(Flow):
        ...


Examples
========

The live demo of the frontend is available at http://demo.viewflow.io/
